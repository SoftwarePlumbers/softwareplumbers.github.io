Examplelet query = Query .fromConstraint({x: Range.lessThan(2), y: 4}) .and({ z: 5}) .or({x:6, y:3, z: Range.greaterThan(99)}) let expression = query.toExpression( (...ands) =&gt; '(' + ands.join(') and (') + ')', (...ors) =&gt; ors.join(' or '), (dimension, operator, value) =&gt; dimension + operator + value );and expression should equal '(x99)'. This is unimpressive until it is explained that the library will also do things like supressing redundant criteria and factoring out common expressions prior to generating an expression. For the latest API documentation see The Software Plumbers Site Project StatusAlpha. It seems functional, and the unit tests pass, but there is quite a bit of work to do before it becomes really useful. × Search results Close "},"Query.html":{"id":"Query.html","title":"Class: Query","body":" abstract-query Classes QueryRange Global DEFAULT_ORDER Class: Query Query A Query represent an arbitrary set of constraints on a set of data. A constraint, in this case, is a mapping of a field name (or dimension) to a Range object. A query can be created from a constraint object which is simply an object with a number of properties, where the name of each property is the field name and the value is a Range (or something that can be converted into a range with Range.from). Once a query has been created, it can be combined with other queries or constraint objects using the and and or methods. A query can be converted into an expression using the toExpression method, which uses the provided callbacks to construct an expression in the desired syntax. The internal query representation is a 'canonical form' composed of a flat sequence of 'ands' joined by 'ors'. Given queries a,b,c,d the internal representation of (a.or(b)).and(c.or(d)) will actually be something like a.and(c).or(a.and(d)).or(b.and(c)).or(b.and(d)). The optimize method can work on this internal representation to remove redundant criteria. The toExpression method attempts to remove common factors from the internal representation before generating an expression. Calling a.and(c).or(a.and(d)).toExpression(...) with appropriate callbacks should generate an expression like a and (c or d) instead of (a and c) or (a and d). new Query(cubes) Construct a query from an array of cube objects. Should be considered a private constructor - use fromConstraint instead to create a query. Parameters: Name Type Description cubes Array.&lt;Cube&gt; An array of cubes. Methods &lt;static&gt; fromConstraint(obj) Create a query from an constraint object The constraint object can have any number of properties. In the following example, the resulting query applies all the following constraints: w &gt;= 3, x == 3, y &gt;= 3, y &lt; 7, z &lt; 7 Parameters: Name Type Description obj Query~ConstraintObject A constraint object. Returns: a Query Example 1 * Query.fromConstraint({ w: [3,], x : 3, y : [3,7], z: [,7]}) and(obj) Create a new query that will return the union of results in this query and with some other query or constraint. Parameters: Name Type Description obj Query | Query~ConstraintObject the other query or constraint Returns: a new compound query that is the union of result sets Type Query andConstraint(other_constraint) Create a new query that will return results in this query that also comply with some other constraint. Parameters: Name Type Description other_constraint Query~ConstraintObject Returns: a new compound query. Type Query andQuery(other_query) Create a new query that will return the intersection of results in this query and some other query. Parameters: Name Type Description other_query Query the other query Returns: a new compound query that is the intersection of result sets from both queries Type Query factor(constraint) Attempt to simplify a query by removing a common factor from the canonical form. Given something like: let query = Query .fromConstraint({x: 2, y : [3,4], z : 8}) .or({x:2, y: [,4], z: 7}) .or({x:3, y: [3,], z: 7}); let { factored, remainder } = query.factor({ x: 2});factored should equal Query.fromConstraint({y : [3,4], z : 8}).or({y: [,4], z: 7}) and remainder should equal Query.fromConstraint({x:3, y: [3,], z: 7}) Parameters: Name Type Description constraint ConstraintObject object to factor out of query Returns: Type Query~FactorResult findFactor() Find the factor that is common to the largest number of sub-expressions in canonical form. Returns: A constraint object containing the common factor, or undefined. Type Object optimize() Delete any redundant critera from the query or(obj) Create a new query that will return the union of results in this query and with some other query or constraint. Parameters: Name Type Description obj Query | Query~ConstraintObject the other query or constraint Returns: a new compound query that is the union of result sets Type Query orConstraint(other_constraint) Create a new query that will return the union of results in this query with some other constraint. Parameters: Name Type Description other_constraint Query~ConstraintObject Returns: a new compound query. Type Query orQuery(other_query) Create a new query that will return the union of results in this query and with some other query. Parameters: Name Type Description other_query Query the other query Returns: a new compound query that is the union of result sets from both queries Type Query toExpression(andExpr, orExpr, operExpr) Convert a query to a an expression. Parameters: Name Type Description andExpr Query~compoundExprBuilder Generate an 'and' expression from several subexpressions orExpr Query~compoundExprBuilder Generate an 'or' expression from several subexpressions operExpr atomicExprBuilder Generate a constraint expression from the name of the property, the operator type, and a value Type Definitions compoundExprBuilder(subexpressions) Callback to build an compound expression from several sub-expressions. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description subexpressions Expression &lt;repeatable&gt; subexpressions from which compound expression is built Returns: a compound expression. Type Expression ConstraintObject A set of constraints. An object with properties names that represent field names on which a constraint is applied, and property values represent a constraint. The constraint may be a simple comparable value, a Range object, or an array with a maximum of two elements representing the lower and upper bounds of a constraint.

Objects extending range should implement 'contains' and 'intersect' operations. Not all ranges are necessarily continuous (like dates/times) or numeric. A Range may also represent a node in a directed graph - in which case 'contains' may mean 'is a parent of' and 'intersect' may mean 'common subtree'. Range also provides a number of static functions that construct new instances of Range (or usually of some subclass of range). new Range() Methods &lt;static&gt; between(lower, upper [, order]) Create a range containing values between the given values Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description lower lower range boundary upper upper range boundary order function &lt;optional&gt; DEFAULT_ORDER compare two values and return true if the first is less than the second. &lt;static&gt; equals() Create a range containing a single value &lt;static&gt; from(bounds [, order]) Create a range.
