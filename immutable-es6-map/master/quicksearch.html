Map API is as close as possible to the vanilla ES6 Map object. However, the clear() function is omitted, as clearly (ba-dum-tsh) that method makes no sense on an immutable object. 'delete' is also modified to return a copy of the original map (with element deleted) rather than 'true' or 'false' as provided in the vanilla ES6 map. new AbstractMap() Methods delete(key) Remove the value stored for a key. A lazy copy is implemented; the map data will not actually be copied until an attempt is made to read it.
