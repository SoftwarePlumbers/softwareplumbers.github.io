Examplelet stream = Stream.of([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]); let result = stream.map(a=&gt;a*7).filter(a=&gt;a%2===0).slice(2,4).join(', ')and result should equal '42, 56'. No itermediate arrays will be created; pipeline is typically more efficient than using the equivalent array methods. Asynchronous StreamsFor i/o operations we may also want to work with promises. Accordingly, we support a modified version of the iterator protocol where next() returns a Promise that resolves to { done, value } as opposed to directly returning it. Pipelines such as the above example will work unchanged on an asynchronous stream with th exception that terminals (such as join) return a Promise rather than a simple value. For the latest API documentation see The Software Plumbers Site Project StatusBeta. It seems functional, and the unit tests pass. Why another set of iterator utilities?There's lots of good ones out there. However, features of this one that may appeal: No transpilers, written in straight javascript No dependencies API is so similar to Array that in many cases a stream pipeline can simply replace existing array-based code Clean class-based implementation × Search results Close "},"AsyncStream.html":{"id":"AsyncStream.html","title":"Class: AsyncStream","body":" iterator-plumbing Classes AsyncStreamBaseAsyncStreamBaseStreamStream Global Global Class: AsyncStream AsyncStream AsyncStream class that simply wraps an asynchronous iterator.
