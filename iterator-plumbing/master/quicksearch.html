Examplelet stream = Stream.of([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]); let result = stream.map(a=&gt;a*7).filter(a=&gt;a%2===0).slice(2,4).join(', ')and result should equal '42, 56'. No itermediate arrays will be created; pipeline is typically more efficient than using the equivalent array methods. For the latest API documentation see The Software Plumbers Site Project StatusBeta. It seems functional, and the unit tests pass. Why another set of iterator utilities?There's lots of good ones out there. However, features of this one that may appeal: No transpilers, written in straight javascript No dependencies API is so similar to Array that in many cases a stream pipeline can simply replace existing array-based code Clean class-based implementation × Search results Close "},"BaseStream.html":{"id":"BaseStream.html","title":"Class: BaseStream","body":" iterator-plumbing Classes BaseStreamConcatenatedStreamFilterStreamMappingStreamStream Class: BaseStream BaseStream Base stream clase that provides core stream operations. A stream is an iterator (it implements next()) with bells on. Various utility methods are provided to filter, map, concatenate, and generally work with streams. For convenience, these methods are based on the methods already available in a javascript array, so the stream API can often be used as a drop-in replacement. In many cases the lazy nature of the stream API (and avoidance of array copies) will make the updated code more efficient than using simple arrays. new BaseStream() Methods concat(iterator) Concatenate this stream with another stream (or an iterator) Parameters: Name Type Description iterator Stream or iterator to concatenate Returns: a new stream that iterates over all items in this stream, then all items in the supplied iterator entries() Create a stream of entries. an 'entry' is a key/value pair - the key in this case is the position of the item in the stream. every(predicate, concext) Check if predicate evaluates to true for all elements in stream Parameters: Name Type Description predicate to check concext passed through to predicate (could be the collection we are iterating over) Returns: true if predicate evaluates to true for every element in the stream filter(predicate, context) Filter a stream Parameters: Name Type Description predicate function predicate to select items from stream context (optional) data to pass through to test function Returns: a stream containing only those items from this stream for which predicate evaluates to true find(predicate, context) Find the first item in a stream for which the predicate evalues to true. Parameters: Name Type Description predicate function function to test items context (optional) data to pass through to test function Returns: the first item in the stream for which predicate evaluates to true findIndex(predicate, context) Find the index of the first item in a stream for which the predicate evalues to true. Parameters: Name Type Description predicate function function to test items context (optional) data to pass through to test function Returns: the index of first item in the stream for which predicate evaluates to true, or -1 forEach(callback, concext) Execute callback for every element in stream Parameters: Name Type Description callback function function to execute concext passed through to predicate (could be the collection we are iterating over) includes(item, fromIndex) Test to see if stream includes a given value Parameters: Name Type Default Description item value to look for fromIndex 0 index to start looking (defaults to 0) indexOf(item, fromIndex) Find the index of the first item in a stream for which the predicate evalues to true. Parameters: Name Type Default Description item value to look for fromIndex 0 index to start looking (defaults to 0) Returns: the index of first item in the stream matching item, or -1 join(separator) Join elements into a string with optional separator Parameters: Name Type Description separator String string to use as separator Returns: all elements of stream joined into a string. map(mapper, context) Apply a map operation to a stream. Parameters: Name Type Description mapper function map function context Passed through to mapping function (could be the colllection we are iterating over) Returns: a stream that is the result of applying mapper to every element in this stream. push(element) Add an element to a stream Equivalent to this.concat(Stream.of(arguments)) Parameters: Name Type Description element to add Returns: a new stream that will iterate through all elmeents of this stream, then the supplied element reduce(callback, value, context) Recuces a stream of values to a single object by repeatedly applying a function. executes accumulator = callback(accumulator, element) for every element in the stream. Parameters: Name Type Description callback function reduction function. value initial value of accumulator context Passed through to reduction function (could be the collection we are iterating over) Returns: the final value of the accumulator slice(begin, index, a) Parameters: Name Type Default Description begin 0 index of first element in slice index of first element after slice a stream containing a subset of elements some(predicate) Find if some element in the stream matches the predicate.
